<h1>Backend Test Project with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</h1>

This is a simple backend project developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. As a frontend developer, I created this project as a learning exercise to explore the basics of backend development, understand how a server works, and experiment with routing, middleware, and database interactions.

<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
The purpose of this project is purely educational. It served as a sandbox for me to:
<ul>
<li>Set up a simple Express server.</li>
<li>Explore how to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
<li>Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.</li>
<li>Experiment with routing, controllers, and middleware in Express.</li>
<li>Learn how to handle basic authentication (e.g., with JWT or sessions).</li>
<li>Understand how to structure a backend project.</li>
<li>Since this is a test project, the code is not production-ready, and there are likely better ways to structure certain parts of the application. However, it represents a valuable learning experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic RESTful API with CRUD operations.</li>
<li>MongoDB connection using Mongoose.</li>
<li>Simple user authentication.</li>
<li>File uploads.</li>
<li>Error handling and middleware usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.</li>
<li>Express: Web framework for Node.js to manage routing and middleware.</li>
<li>MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data.</li>
<li>Mongoose: MongoDB object modelling tool for Node.js, used to interact with the database.</li>
